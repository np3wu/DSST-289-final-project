### Info
Fair Market Rents  (FMRs) are used to determine payment standard amounts for housing rental units. It was meant to enable renters to be able to afford to move to high-opportunity neighborhoods, which include better-performing schools, better transportation, and lower crime rates.

However, a lawsuit in Texas claimed that FMRs created unnecessary barriers for Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) holders, especially people of color, to move to high-opportunity neighborhoods. Small area FMRs (SAFMRs) have been implemented to provide more opportunities for people to acquire higher quality housing by adjusting for individual zip codes rather than for the entire metro areas.

### Purpose
This project attempts to analyze the SAFMRs data set from 2019 to 2024 to determine if rents are increasing in the US even after COVID19.
